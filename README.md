# infinitive.cc website
## Description
 This is my fourth try making a website for myself. This time it uses React and I hope that I won't have the urge to completely remake it in a few months

Currently it's half-baked for mobile view, and don't even get me started on the larger viewports

## A small note
I am building this as an experiment, and I am not trying to sell anything here. Just a showcase :D
Idk who will read this, but you're welcome here! Feel free to explore my spaghetti code or to reach out
